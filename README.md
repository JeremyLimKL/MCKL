C++ - The Great Llama Land
<br/>•	Inspiration: llamas are my favorite animals.
<br/>•	You’re a farmer with 5 lovely llamas that grows in number every year and your life mission is to have a llama empire that exceeds 200 llamas. Unfortunately, there’s a pecky virus called ‘Marvel’ that will multiply and spread and neutered the poor llamas. Your own choice? Summon a magical word that kills half the llamas by “accident” and hope the infected are dead. Just make sure not all of them are dead.
